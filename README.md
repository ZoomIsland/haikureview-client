## What I learned from this project ##
It's become obvious that clear initial vision equates to speedy and thoughtful progress. There were a number of innovations in this project from the outset. Knowing this allowed me to factor my code in reusable ways--just what you need for a React project!

Working with both react-router-dom AND Django Rest Framework at the same time was a challenge! I love React, and am growing fond of Django, but getting both to interact exactly as I wanted felt a little fiddly. I'm pleased with the results, but want to continue learning as I'm sure there are faster, smarter ways of structuring my code (in Django Rest Framework), or utilizing paths in smarter, more effective ways.

React's component system continues to be my favorite. I kept trimming down my components, realizing I didn't need this shell, or that view. I want to continue tightening up this code--particularly on the models or extraneous function end--React makes that interesting. And adding react-router-dom's Switch/Routes, I was able to utilize some fun tricks on my Movie Container.

I'm proud of this capstone project--and hope to continue iterating it to be the pristine, seamless app that any haiku writer would be proud of.
